//First time set-up

1. git init

2. git add .

3. git status

4. git commit -m 'your message'

5. git remote add origin 'your_url_name' 

6. git push -u origin master //then login w/ your creds

//Pushing or updating to git
//inside the staging repo,(not some random directory..)
2. git add . //only if file are not added to upstream

3. git status //check upstream status

4. git commit -m "your message" //commit if changes were not to be made

6. git push -u origin master //then login w/ your creds-->pushing to master i believe,
                                                        can be changed to other branch


6.5. git pull upstream master && git push origin master //CHANGE master to whatever branch is being worked on. 

//To prevent files from pushing: 

1.git restore --staged <file> //Unstanging the file.
